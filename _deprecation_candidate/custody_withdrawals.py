"""
The sample code here demonstrates how to perform a withdrawal using the Bullish API

The calls here require an API key that has been created with 'Withdrawal' privileges and had the destination signed
on the Bullish website.

The script assumes you have setup your environment variables as descried in README.md including generating a JWT token

WARNING: The script here will perform a full withdrawal providing a correct API key and destination are used, please
be careful to avoid any accidental transactions.

Withdrawals consist of 3 basic actions:

    1) Get your destinationId
    2) Request a challenge for your withdrawal requirements
    3) Sign the challenge (assertion) to perform the withdrawal

Note: after getting your destinationId, the withdrawal process is identical for both fiat and crypto.

Step 1: Get your signed destinationId

Note: destinations must be signed on the Bullish website, this cannot be done through the API

This is simply a matter of calling either the crypto or fiat endpoint:

    /trading-api/v1/wallets/withdrawal-instructions/crypto/BTC

    or

    /trading-api/v1/wallets/withdrawal-instructions/fiat/USD

Each of these responses contains a field named destinationId

Step 2: Request a challenge for your withdrawal requirements

Submit the details of the withdrawal you wish to make and the Bullish API will return a challenge for signing

The nonce is used to protect against replay attacks, it is not meant as a universal idempotency key for all withdrawals,
change it for each withdrawal.withdrawal

For a crypto withdrawal, use exactly the same process, but use for example

    {
        network: "BTC",
        symbol: "BTC",
        ...
    }
